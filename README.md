# pyminimap
pyminimap is just some cool stuff I came up with while messing with some games.

The basic concept is to read pixels/templates from a minimap and putting it into relation to the player
position to direct movements or attacks towards enemies. This is mainly achieved by using modules such as
numpy, cv2 and pyautogui.

It works best for isometric games.

# I do not encourage any sort of botting

Please use this like a grown man, I will not take responsibility if you get banned for breaching games ToS (*which you will eventually!*.

The purpose of this is to see how close to a proper injected or packet-rading bot I can get by just reading pixels,

not to ruin anyones fun!
